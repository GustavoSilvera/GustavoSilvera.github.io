My very own personal website built from scratch. Hosted on CMU AFS
# Info
Hello there!<sup>1</sup> Welcome to my personal website. I built this website primarily to document and highlight some of my best and favourite projects over the years, as well as providing a single stop for resume and contact information. I am currently working on updating it to work with my University's public domain, I will try to keep it updated as best I can throughout the years.
